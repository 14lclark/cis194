Here I'll upload my solutions to the homework from Brent Yorgey's CIS194 from UPenn, Spring 2013.
By odd chance, I actually first learned about Haskell from reading Brent Yorgey's blog, The Math Less Traveled.
I've been dabbling with Haskell for about 6 years at this point (about when he was actually teaching this course), never going much further than the extreme basics.

I don't claim to be an amazing Haskeller, or even programmer, so don't take these solutions as gospel -- they're just me trying to get better.

I didn't decide to do this until after I completed the first two assignments, so I'll upload those as-is, and use git to show my progress through the remaining.
